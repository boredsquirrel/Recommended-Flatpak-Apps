## Contributing in this list

This collection thrives when the community keeps it up-to-date, adds secure applicatins etc. But there have to be some rules, to keep it in order

#### GUI-Apps
- All Apps have to be **Flatpaks**
- Free of known **security vulnerabilities**
- **Maintained** (last update less than a year ago)
- Wishlist:
  - ***Wayland*** native
  - ***officially supported*** (in `subset=verified`)
  - no or very little ***[static permissions](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/sandbox-permissions.html)***
  - i.e. use of ***Portals***
  - written in a [memory-safe language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety)
 
#### CLI Apps
- up to date
- written in memory safe languages
- officially supported
- not core apps already present
- general use cases, not too specific

Please avoid duplicate naming. The List should be ordered alphabetically.
The focus is on "apps that are least shitty", as there are often no fitting apps.
So we can recommend for example a Video Player that still has access to the filesystem, if its the least bad there is.
But this insecurity needs to be fixed.

This list should not be contradictory to flathubs safety warnings, but use it as foundation.

Be friendly, no harrassment is tolerated.
