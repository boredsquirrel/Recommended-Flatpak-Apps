# Recommended Flatpak Apps
This list tries to filter out recommended Applications for everyday usage on Linux. It focuses on giving advise for Software following good practices.

If it is actually secure has to be decided per-app though, as it is a very complex task.

### Why this is needed
Flatpaks main purpose is to make every GUI app run on every Linux Distro.

The current state of the Linux Desktop is a mix between old reliable Software like Libreoffice, GIMP, and modern Development that focuses on Permissions, Portals, Wayland and more.

[Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/collection/popular/1) has started to get a really good security rating system, but that has not arrived everywhere. Also you can't sort by it (yet) or exclude insecure apps. It can also be a bit overwhelming, as device access may simply be needed for a platform like a browser to be user friendly.

So this list is a collection of Apps that are needed. Maybe there is no alternative yet, that follows best practices. But at least you can get the most secure one of those.
