# Recommended Flatpak Apps
This list tries to filter out recommended Applications for everyday usage on Linux. It focuses on giving advice for Software following good practices.

If a piece Software is actually secure has to be decided per-app though, as it is a very complex task.

- 🌏 [Web Browser](#web-browser)
- 📧 [Mail Program](#mail-program)
- 💬 [Messenger](#messenger)
- 🌄 [Image Viewer](#image-viewer)
- 📼 [Video Player](#video-player)
- 🎶 [Music Player](#music-player)
- 📄 [PDF Viewer](#pdf-viewer)
- ⚙️ [System](#system)
- 🖥️ [Office](#office)
- 🖌️ [Image Editing](#image-editing)
- 🔒 [File Encryption](#file-encryption)
- 🔑 [Password Management](#password-management)
- ☁️ [Synchronisation & Backups](#synchronisation--backups)
- ⏩ [File sharing](#file-sharing)
- 🎥 [Screen recording / Streaming](#screen-recording--streaming)
- 🧰 [Tools](#tools)
- 📦 [Windows and Android Apps](#running-windows-and-android-apps)

### Why this is needed
Flatpak's main purpose is to make every GUI app run on every Linux Distro.

The current state of the Linux Desktop is a mix between old reliable Software like Libreoffice & GIMP, and modern Development that focuses on Permissions, Portals, Wayland and more.

[Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/collection/popular/1) has started to get a really good security rating system, but that has not arrived in every GUI software store on your Desktop.

Also you can't sort by the rating (yet) or exclude insecure apps.

It can also be a bit overwhelming, as device access may simply be needed for a platform like a browser to be user friendly.

So this list is a collection of Apps where maybe there is no alternative yet, and/or that follow best practices.

## Web Browser

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are not yet recommended as Flatpaks and in general the most complex topic.
> Instead, refer to this [seperate page](https://github.com/boredsquirrel/Recommended-Flatpak-Apps/blob/main/Apps/Browsers.md)

## Mail Program
[Thunderbird](https://flathub.org/apps/org.mozilla.Thunderbird)
Thanks to a good campaign Thunderbird is back on track, modernizing their old code and making the App look modern.

Thunderbird is based on Firefox ESR, just like the Torbrowser. This means we can assume it gets all security fixes of Firefox, while being more stable.

As Thunderbird does not load a lot of dynamic code, sandboxing is not as important. See below on how to disable web browsing functionality!

It is the only feature-complete and widely used Mail program with easy support for [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/), and I highly recommend you to use it. PGP is not great, actually is uses cryptography concepts from the 90s, but it is better than nothing. Some mail providers may support encrypting your inbox, to protect themselves from being forced to share your data.

> [!NOTE]
> Anyways, Thunderbird is not perfectly secure out of the box, so you may want to apply the [Thunderbird hardening settings](https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/thunderbird-user.js).
> The Fork "Betterbird" is no longer needed for features like the "card view" that got integrated into Thunderbird. It may be behind on updates.
> Instead, you can use [Dove](https://codeberg.org/celenity/Dove) and [The Thunderbird user.js](https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/thunderbird-user.js/wiki).


This will have some drawbacks, and a middleway is needed, that allows
- Local timezone
- Extension installs
- Calendar Event Adding

The Hardening configuration is a deviation of the [Arkenfox userjs](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js), which is a security & privacy configuration set for Firefox. As a mail program is mostly used differently than a web browser (you only contact people you know and mostly in the same timezone) your requirements may be different.

### Addons
You should not install dozens of Addons, but some are really useful.
- [DKIM Verifier](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/dkim-verifier/): Very important, it shows a Warning if the mail origin may be manipulated.

Nice to have:
- [Thunderbird Conversations](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/gmail-conversation-view): Useful threads for mail exchange with the same person or group.
- [QuickText](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/quicktext): Fill in snippets like greetings or closings
- [Nextcloud Attachments](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/filelink-nextcloud-owncloud): This addon allows to send attachments via your FOSS cloud storage, to work with attachment size limitations and save data. May also support password-protected file sharing (only secure when using PGP!)

## Messenger
Most popular messengers are way more secure than Mail, phone calls or SMS. Many clients are using Electron which is a security issue, because it bundles a less secure Chromium, is overcomplex and often outdated.

If messengers have a web client, use that instead of the Electron app. Especially with Chromium based browsers, you can create a progressive webapp which behaves like a local app.

### Matrix
Fractal
- 🖥️ GTK, native Wayland support

### ⚠️ Warnings
Mixin: outdated runtime, not well maintained

Telegram, Teams, Skype, Discord,... : all not [E2EE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) so your messages will be read, scanned, used to train AI etc. This can lead to identity theft, impersonation attacks or hackers getting your data. If the provider doesn't have your messages in plain text, they can't be hacked.

Telegram encrypted Chats: Outdated cryptography, a lot of metadata, opt-in encryption

Session: Fork of Signal protocol that was made a lot worse, [source](https://soatok.blog/2025/01/14/dont-use-session-signal-fork/)

## System

### ⚠️ [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal)
If you are not on KDE, this is an essential tool to manage Flatpak Permissions easily.
- 🖥️ GTK, Wayland support
- 💾 no filesystem access



### [Mission Center](https://flathub.org/apps/io.missioncenter.MissionCenter)
- Features similar to Windows' Task Manager.

### [Firmware](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Firmware)
- Not needed when using KDE Discover, but useful on other Desktops.
- 🖥️ GTK, Wayland suppport

Displays your firmware versions. In the end nothing more than

```
fwupdmgr get-devices
fwupdmgr upgrade
```

- reported to work really well

[Xournal++](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp)
- 🖥️ GTK3, Wayland support
- permissions get better Flatpak adaption
- 💾 no filesystem portal support currently


### Libreoffice
is the only complete Office Suite for easily editing WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) Documents.
- huge and old codebase, Flatpak can only be installed as a bundle of all
- 💾 incompatible with portals currently ([Issue](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=159311)
- 🖥️ Wayland support (own toolkit)

### Alternative Solutions
#### Text Editing
**[Typst](https://typst.app)**
- Modern LaTeX alternative, with easier syntax and fancy features like incremental updates
- Install locally using cargo (Rust package manager)
- Support for [VSCodium](https://flathub.org/apps/com.vscodium.codium) is currently best
- 🖥️ CLI 💾 unrestricted, no portals

**Markdown**
- Many available Editors, [search on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/search?q=markdown)

**LaTeX**
- [Setzer](https://flathub.org/apps/org.cvfosammmm.Setzer) using GTK, [Kile](https://flathub.org/apps/org.kde.kile) using Qt
- 🖥️ both have native Wayland support
- 💾 replaceme

**Good general Text Editors**
- [VSCodium](https://flathub.org/apps/com.vscodium.codium) uses a Microsoft codebase but has tracking removed. The Flatpak is unofficial and has limited features
- Kate by KDE, currently only [Kwrite](https://flathub.org/apps/org.kde.kwrite) (a subset of Kate) is on Flathub
- [Lapce](https://flathub.org/apps/dev.lapce.lapce): modern, but work in progress editor written in Rust, [Website](https://lapce.dev/#)

#### Presentations
You may just use PDFs for presenting, which can open everywhere. 

Creating those can be done using Markdown, LaTeX and more. You may want to use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), which has no GUI and thus no Flatpak.

Otherwise, Libreoffice Impress is the best tool.

#### Calculations
[Gnumeric](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnumeric.Gnumeric)
- Very similar to Libreoffice Calc, support for the same filetypes
- 💾 restricted filesystem permission but [no portal support](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnumeric/-/issues/760) (so you need to extend it)
- 🖥️ GTK, Wayland support

- [Nitrokey](https://www.nitrokey.com/)
- [Solokeys](https://leetronics.de/en/shop/)
- [Onlykey](https://onlykey.io/)

⚠️ Yubikey is not recommended, as they are proprietary and the firmware can not be updated, making them throwaway devices after the first discovered security vulnerability.

## Synchronisation & Backups

- not an official Flatpak
- 🖥️ Electron, Wayland support

Notes:
- many local backup Flatpaks need to be configured manually!
- use Cryptomator for encryption if you don't trust your provider
- ⚠️ often no client at all without using Electron, `nextcloudcmd` may be available

## File sharing
### [LocalSend](https://flathub.org/apps/org.localsend.localsend_app)
- great cross-platform tool for filesharing over Wifi
- 💾 minimal permissions, static Download folder, no portal usage

## Tools
### [Decoder](https://flathub.org/apps/com.belmoussaoui.Decoder)
Modern QR Code Scanner
- using portals
- written in Rust
- 🖥️ GTK, Wayland support
- 💾 no filesystem access

⚠️ Problem: saves history with no off-switch. Fix: Delete the App storage after closing it by editing its Desktop entry:

```
cd ~/.local/share/applications
# copy Desktop Entry
cp /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.belmoussaoui.Decoder/current/active/export/share/applications/com.belmoussaoui.Decoder.desktop ./
# make the App delete its storage after closing
sed -i 's/--command=decoder com.belmoussaoui.Decoder/--command=decoder com.belmoussaoui.Decoder && rm -rf $HOME/.var/app/com.belmoussaoui.Decoder/g' com.belmoussaoui.Decoder.desktop
```

### [Impression](https://flathub.org/apps/io.gitlab.adhami3310.Impression)
An easy tool for flashing ISO images to USB flashdrives
- 💾 no filesystem permissions, using portals
- written in Rust, using udisks2 from the freedesktop.org runtime
- 🖥️ GTK, Wayland support

## Running Windows and Android Apps
WINE has become very popular through the work of Valve, Codeweavers and many open source contributors. But don't forget that running random Windows apps (maybe from shady sources) is a huge security risk on your otherwise secure system.

### Bottles
- perfectly packaged, easy to use WINE interface
- 🖥️ GTK, Wayland support
- 💾 no filesystem access, uses portals
- minimal permissions

### ProtonupQt
- can install various WINE variants like Valve-proton, Proton-GE (recommended) and more to the used launchers
- 🖥️ Qt, Wayland support
- 💾 restricted static permissions to install into other Flatpak's directories

### ⚠️ Waydroid
- 💾 rootful LXC container, not isolated at all
- using an outdated version of Android (Android 11, 14 is currently used)
- 🖥️ Wayland only

You may want to prefer using a virtual machine with [BlissOS](https://blissos.org/index.html) or even `qemu-aarch64` and a regular ARM image to have all Apps work. There is no easy install solution currently, but that would be a huge security benefit. Running in a rootless Podman container would also be a big improvement.

## What to do now?
Check your apps, see if you find more secure alternatives. If an app is not adapted to modern standards (and Desktops don't yet have GUI popups for filesystem access), you need Flatseal/KDE's systemsettings page to restrict the permissions of the apps to your needs.

Especially filesystem access is critical, so it is important to know the locations applications write their files, to be able to allowlist only them + chosen locations.

Common locations for files, instead of `xdg-host` are:

```
/home/USER or /var/home/USER
/mnt or /var/mnt
/run/media/USER
```

You can also test Wayland support when it is still experimental and report bugs.

Improve the permissions of apps you use, and help packagers improve them!
